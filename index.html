    <p class="pera-two"> As men, we tend to chug along aspiring to be what men should be. Strong, protective, and determined providers. But what about the other side? Compassion, empathy, and gentleness. Tenderness when required. The ability to tell the people that mean the most to us that we love them. 10 years from now strive to become fully complete emotionally.</p>
